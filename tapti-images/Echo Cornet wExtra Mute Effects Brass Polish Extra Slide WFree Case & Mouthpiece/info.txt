The airflow is  redirected to the second bell (by depressing the fourth valve) a muted effect Has been  achieved, not unlike that resulting from the use of a metal Harmon-style mute. Typically the echo bells are "attachments" which are  removable, so the horn can be held and played conventionally. But the fourth valve is a permanent part of the valve cluster itself.
