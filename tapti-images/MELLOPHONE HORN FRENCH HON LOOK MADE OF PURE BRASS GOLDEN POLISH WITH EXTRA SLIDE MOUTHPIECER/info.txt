It is a horn which has a resemblance to French Horn. It can be said it is the Indian version of French horn. It has very complex tubing. It normally has 3 valves. We have added one more valve adding the 4th valve to add some more variation. It has 12 feet 4.5 inches of tubing wrapped around to compact. It is a B flat instrument, however with the help of 4th valve we can generate F pitch.
