The cornet is a brass instrument very similar to the trumpet, distinguished by its conical bore, compact shape, and mellower tone quality. The most common cornet is a transposing instrument in B♭.

 It playes more melodic passages.

Cornets are  made in a given key (usually the key of B♭) play at the same pitch, and the technique for playing the instruments is nearly identical..

The tubing of the cornet has a mostly conical bore, starting very narrow at the mouthpiece and gradually widening towards the bell which is primarily responsible for its characteristic warm, mellow tone,

The conical bore of the cornet also makes it more agile than the trumpet when playing fast passages, The cornet is often preferred for young beginners as it is easier to hold, with its centre of gravity much closer to the player.
