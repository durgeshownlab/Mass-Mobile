Piccolo trumpet is one of the smallest instrument of trumpet family. It is  in B-flat, with swappable leadpipes to tune the instrument to B-flat (shorter) or A (longer). The tubing in the B-flat piccolo trumpet is exactly one-half the length of that in a standard B-flat trumpet. This trumpet  has four valves instead of three â€” the fourth valve usually lowers the pitch by a fourth. This extends the low range and provides alternate fingerings and improved intonation for some notes. It is made of pure brass with brass polish.
